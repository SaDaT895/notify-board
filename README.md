# NotifyBoard

An admin panel to manage notifications.

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.0.7.

## Architecture

I kept it simple:
- Angular Material (since that's what I have most experience with)
- Jest instead of Karma/Jasmine for the same reason
- LocalStorage for data-persistance with an observable-store strategy
- Focus on usability, code strcuture and readability

## Get started:

`npm install && npm start` to start local frontend.

`npm test` to run test(s).
